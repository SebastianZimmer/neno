# Graph View Manual
In the Graph View, your notes are shown as a network graph in which notes are
displayed as graph nodes and links between notes are displayed as graph edges.
You can move notes and add and delete links. Please note, that you have to save
the current state to make your modifications to the graph permanent.

## Move a node
Just drag a node and drop it where you want it to be.

## Move several nodes at once
To move several nodes at once, first select the nodes which you want to
move. To do this, press and hold the `S` key and click on the nodes you
want to select. After that, drag one of the selected nodes and drop it where
you want it to be. All selected nodes will follow. Please note that the node
you drag is always included in the movement, regardless of whether it is
selected or not.

## Create a new edge
To create a new edge, press and hold the `SHIFT` key, then click and hold the
mouse button on one of the nodes of the link to be created and move your cursor
to the other node of the link to be created. Let go of the mouse button. The
new edge is displayed now.
